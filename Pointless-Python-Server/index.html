Hello world - see <a href="http://pointlessprogramming.wordpress.com/2011/02/13/python-cgi-tutorial-1/" target="_blank">Pointless Programming</a> but note the comments about using "python -m CGIHTTPServer" - that's what worked for me.
<p/>
So to run this:
<ol>
  <li/>Open shell in directory containing this file
  <li>Run: <code>python -m CGIHTTPServer</code>
  <li>In your web browser go to: <code>http://localhost:8000</code>
</ol>
